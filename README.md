#### Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/iplaces/astro-zsh-theme.git
```


#### Theme 
1. Copy `io.zsh-theme` file into the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory.
2. Change the theme variable name to `ZSH_THEME="io"` in `~/.zshrc`
3. Reload ZSH with `source ~/.zshrc`

#### Color
You can choose your favorite iterm color scheme in [iTerm Color Schemes Site](http://www.iterm2colorschemes.com) or just set it by yourself. In the screenshots I use `Darkside themes` created by [bahlo](https://github.com/bahlo/iterm-colors/blob/master/colors/Darkside.itermcolors).

1. `iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Colors Tab`
2. Click **Color Presets** (drop-down in the lower right corner)
3. Click **Import**
4. Select the color scheme file
5. Select the color scheme from **Load Presets**
